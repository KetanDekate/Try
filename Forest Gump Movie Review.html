    Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.</p>

    <p>Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.</p>

        <p>I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, "Oh, what a wonderful life," - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.</p>

            <p>But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.</p>

                <p>I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.
